    <h2>SPACE SUMMER CAMP</h2>
    <p> After my first year in university; That very summer I was
        apart of the tech for good project. This project consist
        of about 20 students from the Information techology program. 
        Their were many different projects to choose from but our group
        decided to focus on space research. This resarch was specifically on 
        satellite communication and we were also able to capture our own
        satellite images using RTL-SDR technology. At the end we were able to share 
        our research with highschool students.

    <h2>IMPORTANCE OF UX-UI DESIGN</h2>
    <p>In my first year of university I had class called Writing and Critical Thinking.
        This class consist of learning to write business emails and basic professional writing.
        We did a project on what career we see ourselves in a chose UX-UI design because 
        I always enounter seniors with the common problem of not being able to use certain applications
        ont their phone because it's not straight forward to use. This is why I did my project on
        the career of UX-UI design.

    <h2>DANGERS OF USING PUBLIC-WIFI</h2>
    <p>In my second of university I wrote a paper 
        about the dangers of using public Wi-Fi in places like coffee shops or airports.
         It explained how hackers can steal personal information through attacks such as spying,
          fake Wi-Fi, and malware. A real example showed how weak passwords led to a major security breach.
           The project also talked about tools like Wireshark to test networks safely. In the end, it focused on ways to stay safe,
            like using encryption, strong passwords, and being careful online

    <h2>TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING CACHE UTILIZATION</h2>
    <p> In my second year of university I wrote a paper called Techniques For Improving Cache Utilization.
         The paper explains how cache memory helps computers work faster by storing important data closer to the CPU. 
         It looks at different ways to make cache more efficient, like hardware support, cache hints, cache replacement policies,
          and cache bypassing. These methods can speed up computers, save energy, and make systems run smoother, but they also have
           drawbacks like higher cost and complexity. Overall, the research shows that
         improving cache use is important for better computer performance and should continue to be studied in the future.</p>

I chose these sizes so the website looks good on any device. The phone.css file (up to 600px) is for small screens like phones, so everything fits without side scrolling. The tablet.css file (601pxâ€“1024px) is for medium screens like tablets, giving more room. The laptop.css file (1025px and bigger) is for large screens like laptops and desktops, where there is space for bigger layouts and images. These sizes match the most common devices people use. Overall I chose these dimension because it is what's common that people use.

For the contact page, I added a gradient background to make it more attractive. It starts with a bright yellow-gold color (#fbd342) on the left and blends into a darker orange (#f78d2f) on the right. I chose these colors because they give the page a warm, welcoming look and make the design more modern. The gradient also makes the background more interesting than a plain solid color that I used in the previous color schme, while still keeping the text clear and easy to read.

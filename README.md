I chose these sizes so the website looks good on any device. The phone.css file (up to 600px) is for small screens like phones, so everything fits without side scrolling. The tablet.css file (601pxâ€“1024px) is for medium screens like tablets, giving more room while still staying simple. The laptop.css file (1025px and bigger) is for large screens like laptops and desktops, where there is space for bigger layouts and images. These sizes match the most common devices people use.

I used a gradient on my contact page to make the background change smoothly from one color to another, as requested. The color scheme starts with a yellow-gold color (#fbd342) on the left and then gently blends into a darker orange color (#f78d2f) on the right.
